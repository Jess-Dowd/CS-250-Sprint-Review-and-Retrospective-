## Reflection on Agile Development and Teamwork

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves actively listening to stakeholders and users, understanding their requirements, and translating these needs into functional specifications. Creating user stories helps with this by providing a clear and concise way to capture user requirements from the user's perspective. User stories describe what the user wants to achieve, allowing developers to understand the end goal and prioritize features that deliver the most value. For example, during the SNHU Travel project, user stories helped in breaking down the requirements into manageable tasks and ensured that the development was aligned with user expectations.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by following a structured methodology that includes planning, designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software. Adopting Agile processes, such as iterative development, continuous integration, and regular feedback loops, helps in adapting to changes quickly and improving the quality of the software. In future development work, I hope to incorporate Agile practices like Scrum for better team collaboration, Kanban for visualizing workflow, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) for ensuring code quality and reliability.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively participating in team activities, communicating effectively, and collaborating with others to achieve common goals. It involves being open to feedback, willing to help others, and committed to the team's success. Good team members are reliable, contribute their skills and knowledge, and support a positive team environment. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, regular communication and collaboration helped the team stay aligned, such as when the direction of the project changed to wellness vacations.
